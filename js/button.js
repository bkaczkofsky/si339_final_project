    document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "Improvising is like a conversation. It is more unpredictable. You don’t know what’s going to happen. If you were talking to someone, I mean, you don’t just start randomly talking about anything off the top of your head, you have a topic that you’re dealing with. That’s what an improvised solo is, it’s a conversation with the rhythm section and everyone who is soloing at the time.";

Then came Ragtime, the Blues, and the sacred music of the black church can I get a witness. Amen. By the end of the 19th century, all that was in the air, for New Orleans musicians to grab, to absorb, to transform, and the eventual result would be a brand new art. Not spirituals or Blues or Ragtime, but everything, everything all at once. Jazz.";
    
    document.getElementById("demo8").innerHTML = "Duke Ellington once said music is neither new or old. It’s either good or the other kind. We play all of Jazz, as much as we can, we say “all Jazz is modern”. And we may play newer songs or we may play Duke Ellington. We may play a song that I wrote last night. But we feel that all of it is important and worth hearing, and we’re going to try to swing and play with the same soul on all of the music.";
